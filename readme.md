# POSN Computer Practice Repository

This repository contains all my practice code and course materials for POSN (Program for Olympiad in Science and Mathematics) Computer programming.

## Structure

- [`template.cpp`](template.cpp) - Basic C++ template for competitive programming problems
- `.cph/` - Competitive Programming Helper extension files
- `.vscode/` - Visual Studio Code configuration files

## Template Usage

The [`template.cpp`](template.cpp) file includes:
- Fast I/O optimization with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` and `cin.tie(0)`
- Basic structure for competitive programming solutions

## Getting Started

1. Use the template from [`template.cpp`](template.cpp) for new problems
2. The workspace is configured for C++ development with proper file associations
3. Competitive Programming Helper extension is set up for testing solutions

## Notes

This repository serves as a personal collection of POSN computer programming practice materials and solutions.
